ðŸ“šâœ¨ BiblioBeam: GraphQL-Google Books API powered book search. Discover, save, and manage your reads with ease.
### Google Books Search Engine with GraphQL

### Description

This project refactors a fully functional Google Books API search engine from a RESTful API to use GraphQL with Apollo Server. The app is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and enables users to search for books and save them to their personal accounts.

The application allows for user authentication, book saving, and viewing saved books, all powered by GraphQL and Apollo.
